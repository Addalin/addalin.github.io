abstract: 'We present a wide-field imaging approach to optically sense underwater sediment resuspension events. It uses wide-field multi-directional views and diffuse backlight. Our approach algorithmically quantifies the amount of material resuspended and its spatiotemporal distribution. The suspended particles affect the radiation that reaches the cameras, hence the captured images. By measuring the radiance during and prior to resuspension, we extract the optical depth on the line of sight per pixel. Using computed tomography (CT) principles, the optical depths yield estimation of the extinction coefficient of the suspension, per voxel. The suspended density is then derived from the reconstructed extinction coefficient.'
